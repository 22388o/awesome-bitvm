# Awesome BitVM

A curated list of resources around  BitVM

## About

BitVM is a computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. This requires no changes to the networkâ€™s consensus rules.

Committing to a large program in a Taproot address requires significant amounts of off-chain computation and communication, however the resulting on-chain footprint is minimal. As long as both parties collaborate, they can perform arbitrarily complex, stateful off-chain computation, without leaving any trace in the chain. On-chain execution is required only in case of a dispute.
